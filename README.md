## Description 
 
The purpose of this exercise was to JavaScript, JQuery, JQuery UI and JQuery Touch and Punch to create a task tracker/ kanban board hybrid. The Task Master Pro also utilizes MomentJS and javaScript timers to indicate which due dates are current, which due dates are nearing and which due dates have expired.
